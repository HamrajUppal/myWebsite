        <h6>Folding Treadmill</h6>
        <p>Ideal for those short on space, a folding treadmill delivers all the benefits of a home running machine with the added bonus of saving valuable floor space. 
          Once you've finished your run, simply lift the treadmill deck up towards the console to lock it in to place and halve the machine's footprint. On certain models of folding treadmills, 
          this process is automated, meaning it's incredibly easy for just one person to operate, and reduces the risk of any injury or damage occurring. What's more, folding treadmills are much 
          easy to clean around and underneath than other alternatives</p>
          <br> 
        <h6>Non-Folding Treadmill</h6>
        <p>More stable than a folding treadmill, a non-folding treadmill is built to withstand more intense usage. Often featuring high powered motors and larger decks, they are ideal for longer or 
          faster runs, and often boast a higher maximum weight capacity too. Being larger units, a non-folding treadmill is a wise choice for home gyms with a little more floor space, but some models have the 
          added benefit of in-built transport wheels to move the treadmill around easily if needed</p>
